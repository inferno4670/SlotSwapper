# SlotSwapper

A peer-to-peer calendar app where users can mark busy slots as *swappable* and exchange them with other users.

## Overview

SlotSwapper is a full-stack web application that allows users to:
- Manage personal events
- Mark and view swappable slots
- Request and approve slot swaps with other users
- View real-time updates in their calendar

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT for authentication
- Bcrypt for password hashing

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for API requests

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud)

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   PORT=5000
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - User signup
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login

### Events
- `GET /api/events` - Get all events for user
- `POST /api/events` - Create new event
- `GET /api/events/:id` - Get event by ID
- `PUT /api/events/:id` - Update event
- `DELETE /api/events/:id` - Delete event

### Slot Swapping
- `GET /api/swappable-slots` - Get all swappable slots (excluding requester's)
- `POST /api/swap-request` - Create swap request
- `POST /api/swap-response/:requestId` - Respond to swap request

## Deployment

### MongoDB Atlas Setup
1. Create a free MongoDB Atlas account at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
2. Create a new cluster (M0 free tier)
3. Create a database user with read/write permissions
4. Add your IP address to the whitelist
5. Get the connection string from the "Connect" button

### Backend Deployment (Render)
1. Sign up at https://render.com/
2. Create a new Web Service
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Set the following environment variables:
   - `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET`: A strong secret key
   - `NODE_ENV`: production
5. Set build command: `npm install`
6. Set start command: `npm start`

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
1. Sign up at https://vercel.com/
2. Create a new project
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure the project:
   - Framework: Create React App
   - Root Directory: frontend
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `build`
   - Install Command: `npm install`
5. Set the following environment variables:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL`: Your deployed backend URL (e.g., https://your-app.onrender.com/api)

### Vercel Configuration
This project includes a `vercel.json` file that configures the build process for deployment. The configuration ensures that:
- The frontend is built correctly from the `frontend` directory
- Static assets are served properly
- API requests are directed to the backend

## Known Issues and Assumptions

1. The application assumes a MongoDB database is available
2. Real-time updates are not yet implemented (planned for future releases)
3. Error handling could be more comprehensive
4. Input validation is basic and could be improved

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement WebSocket notifications for real-time updates
2. Add more comprehensive input validation
3. Implement password reset functionality
4. Add user profile management
5. Improve UI/UX with better styling and responsiveness
